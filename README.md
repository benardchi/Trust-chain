Trust-Chain Smart Contract

A decentralized **on-chain trust and reputation system** built on the **Stacks blockchain** using **Clarity**.  
**Trust-Chain** enables users, organizations, and DAOs to build verifiable credibility through transparent identity verification and peer-endorsed reputation tracking.

---

Project Overview

**Trust-Chain** aims to establish a **trust framework for decentralized ecosystems**, where reputation and accountability are earned, verified, and stored immutably on the blockchain.  
It provides mechanisms for user registration, trust score updates, and third-party verifications — all governed by transparent smart contract logic.

---

Core Features

- **Decentralized Reputation:**  
  Every user maintains a tamper-proof trust score on-chain.

- **Peer Verification:**  
  Entities can verify and endorse the credibility of other users.

- **Trust Adjustment:**  
  Trust scores evolve dynamically based on positive and negative interactions.

- **Transparency & Security:**  
  All actions and updates are immutably recorded on the Stacks blockchain.

- **Integration Ready:**  
  Can be extended to support decentralized identity (DID) systems and DAO governance.
